# Our solution
Search about fruit, would showcase the details about a specific fruit and show nutrition information.

# Our API
https://www.fruityvice.com/api/

We will be using fruityvice. It shows data about fruit all in one place, things such as the amount of carbohydrates, protein, fat, calories, even the genetic family, and more. We will use this to populate our app with fruit names and use GET methods to pull information from the API when a user needs to learn more about a particular fruit. A website with a search engine where you can search any fruit, includes a submission form request to add a new fruit or an exotic fruit that may not be in the search engine already. We can consider a search engine where the search query is checked within the API. If it’s listed, it will direct the user there. Otherwise, it will direct the user to a “request a new fruit” page with a button to try again in case they made a typo.

# Our Proposal
Our proposed solution will help people make healthier food choices, targeting health-conscious people, people looking to become healthier, nutritionists, and people who need to be on a special diet. Convenient access to vital information encourages a balanced diet and will generally help promote a healthier well-being. By showcasing the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in fruits, it can educate users on the overall health benefits. This app supports weight management and fitness goals. This app will contribute to a healthier society.
